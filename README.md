# Introduction

## Motivations

*Why are you starting this project?*



This project is motivated by the poor documentation practices observed in web-based open source hardware projects. Indeed, the lack of standardised open source hardware documentation guidelines make the reuse - with or without modification - of the solution cumbersome.

## Goals

*What will you deliver in this project?*



This project will deliver a template standing as a minimum viable documentation for open source hardware. By cloning this repository, any maker will be able to fill in the template provided in the folder entitled "Documentation".

## History

*What are the existing sources that you have reused in this project? Where did you find them?*



The documentation template reuses exemplary documentation practices borrowed from:

- [NASA JPL Open Source Rover Project](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover) - section "Skills Necessary"
- ...
