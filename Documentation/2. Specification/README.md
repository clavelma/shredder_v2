# **Specification**

*The specification consists in describing the product with a "black box" external view to capture the intermediate technical objects (stakeholders, external interfaces, services, and constraints) that serve to, *in fine*, elucidate the product requirements.*

## **How to document the specifications?** 
  
## **1. Stakeholders:**

### Template of stakeholders
  
   * Clients
   * Users
   * Partners
   * Media
   * European standards
   * Environment

  *The link below can be used to define the stakeholders of your project/product.*

## **2. External interfaces**

## 3. Service *(synonyms: external function, capability)* 
<details>
  <summary>Click to see the guideline!</summary>
  
- **Definition:** *A service is an effect intended by a stakeholder resulting from the interaction of the product with its environment (i.e. what the  product is for).*

- **Comments:**
  - *Services provide users with an exchange value that can be included in an economic system (e.g. airlines buy flight hours).*
  - *Services are intended effects that can be observed from outside the product ("black box" external view), but not from outside an internal component ("white box" internal view).*
  - *Services are defined in a solution neutral-way.*
  - *Services can be stated as follows: The [Product] shall enable [Stakeholder] [Action verb] (e.g. The product shall enable end-user to clean its teeth)*
  - *we often reason in terms of action verbs to communicate expected behaviors, so it would be nice to be able to search designs with action verbs*

  What does contain the minimum documentation of the service to stakeholders?
  
  Example of services for ADD-ONS of XYZ Cargo

      - 1.2 liquid (5 litrs)
    - The ADD-ONS shall enable the food producer to heat food
      -  2.1solid (150 deg Celcius)
      - 2.2 liquid (80 deg Celcius)
    - The ADD-ONS shall enable the food producer to cool down food for 4 hours
