# **Specification**

*The specification consists in describing the product with a "black box" external view to capture the intermediate technical objects (stakeholders, external interfaces, services, and constraints) that serve to, *in fine*, elucidate the product requirements.* 

## **Stakeholders:**
*What entities influence the product throughout its life cycle ?*

- **Definition:** *Stakeholders generally refer to all the actors (human and non-human) who have an interest in a product. Among the stakeholders, there are both internal players, such as users and participants of the project, and external players that are represented by the potential user of products or external entities.*

- **Comments:**

  - *A stakeholder is not necessarily a person (e.g. considering airports as a stakeholder when designing a two-deck aircraft).*
  - *A stakeholder can indirectly affect the product (e.g. considering neighborhood when designing a nuclear power plant).*
  - *A stakeholder can indirectly be affected by the product (e.g. considering the local biodiversity when designing an airport).*

  ```
  Metadata:
  
  - Stakeholder name
  ```

## **External interfaces**
*What are the external entities interacting with the product?*

- **Definition:**  *External interfaces are interactions between the product and the stakeholders.*

- **Comments:**
  - *An interface is made of a port (in, out, or in-out)*
  - *An interface is made of a flow (matter, energy, or signal)*
  
 ```
  Metadata:
  
  - Stakeholder name 1
    - Flow name 1
    - Flow name 2
    - ...
  - Stakeholder name 2
    - Flow name 1'
    - Flow name 2'
    - ...
  ```

## Service *(synonyms: external function, capability)* 
*What are the services that the product provides to stakeholders?*

- **Definition:** *A service is an effect intended by a stakeholder resulting from the interaction of the product with its environment (i.e. what the  product is for).*

- **Comments:**
  - *Services provides users with and exchange value that can be included in an economic system (e.g. airlines buy flight hours).*
  - *Services are intended effects that can observed from outside the product ("back box" external view), but not from outside an internal component ("white box" internal view).*
  - *Services are defined in a solution neutral way.*
  - *Services can be stated as follows : The [Product] shall enable [Stakeholder] [Action verb] (e.g. The product shall enable end-user to clean its teeths)*
  
 ```
  Metadata:
  Action verb (we often reason in terms of action verbs to communicate expected behaviours, so it would be nice to be able to search designs with action verbs)
  
    - Services to stakeholder 1
      - Service 1.1:...
      - Service 1.2:...
      - ...
    - Services to stakeholder 2
      - Service 2.1:...
      - Service 2.2:...
      - ...
    - ...
  ```
  
## Constraint *(Synonyms: non function requirement)*
*What are the constraints that expose to the product by stakeholders?*

- **Definition:**  *A constraint is a choice that makes certain designs "not allowed" or inappropriate for its intended use.*

- **Comments:**
  - *Constraints provide the needs of stakeholders that shall impose in the design.*
  - *Constraints can be stated as follows: The [Stakeholder] shall enable [Action verb] [Product] (e.g. The user shall enable to dismantle the product with a maximum one wrench and one screwdriver).*
  
   ```
  Metadata:
  It would be good to express the constraints with an action verb to communicate expected needs in design.  
  
    - Exposed constraints by stakeholder 1
      - Constraint 1.1:...
      - Constraint 1.2:...
      - ...
    - Exposed constraints by stakeholder 2
      - Constraint 2.1:...
      - Constraint 2.2:...
      - ...
    - ...
  ```

## Requirement *(Synonyms: performance specifications)*

- **Definition:** *A requirement is a formal statement that specifies when condition C is true, property P of object O is actual and its value shall belong  to domain D.*

- **Comments:**
  -  *The minimum set of independent requirements can completely characterize the needs of the product.*
  -  *equirement can state as follows: The [stakeholder] need to [Action verb] [object] at [Condition] for [Property]   (e.g. The maker needs to do the machining of a cylindrical piece at 500rpm for 50Â°c of uniform temperature).* 
  
  ```
  Metadata:
  It includes: 'What' we want to achieve a minimum set of requirements a system must satisfy.
  
    - Requirements for service 1
      - Requirement 1.1:...
      - Requirement 1.2:...
      - ...
    - Requirements for service 2
      - Requirement 2.1:...
      - Requirement 2.2:...
      - ...
    - ...
  ```
