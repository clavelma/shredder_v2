# **Assembly**

*I would like to enable makers to understand the steps of constructing a finished product from components or partially compiled units.* 

## **How to document an assembly or disassembly process?**

*Assembly instruction can guide the makers to follow the process of assembly or disassembly of components of a product.*

### **Assembly instructions** 
<details>

 - **Definition:** *Assembly instructions could illustrate visually and with words and text how to assemble or disassemble the mechanical and electrical components of the product.*


 ```
What does include the content of assembly instruction? 

 1. Required skills for assembly
    - Operate drilling machine
    - Operate Band Saw/Dremel
    - Etc.
 2. List of the tools for assembly or disassembly
    - Mandatory
       - Allen Keyset
       - Imperial wrench set
       - Etc.
    - Optional
       - Drill press
       - Etc. 
 3. Assembly sequence
    - Part list for mechanical parts: is a complete list of all parts needed to build the complete product(refer to the BOM at manufacturing section)
       - Item numbers: are based on the assembly structure, that is, the order in which parts are displayed in assembly.
       - Part number or drawing number: which is a reference back to the detail drawing (refer to the BOM). 
       - Description: is usually a part name or a complete description of parts.
       - Quantity is the number of that particular part used on this assembly. 
       - Image of each part
    - Datasheet of components for electronic parts
       - Description of features
          - Core
          - Memories
          - Advanced connectivity
          - etc.
       - Device summary
          - Reference
          - Part number 
       - How to use the parts?
    - Describing the machining/ fabrication if it is necessary during the assembly (refer to manufacturing and see the template below)
      - Machine used
      - Sequence of process 
    - The set of steps necessary to properly assemble the parts
       - Description of the assembly at each step
       - Identifying the joining technology at each step
          - Screwing
          - Bolting
          - Soldering
          - Etc.
