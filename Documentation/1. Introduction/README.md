# Introduction

*The introduction to the documentation aims to provide more details about the project goal, and context. This introduction should allow the reader to first understand the motivation of the project and also who is involved or has been involved in its creation. As this documentation structure aims at fostering the reuse of the technical contents of the project, it is important to understand well the context.*

## Motivations

*This section addresses the question: Why are you starting this project?*


As an example:
  
The project [BCN3D Moveo](https://github.com/BCN3D/BCN3D-Moveo/) is motivated by the high cost 
of the materials that undergraduate students must use for learning how to engineer mechatronics systems.

## Goals

*This section addresses the question: What will be delivered in this project?* 

As an example: 
  
The project [BCN3D Moveo](https://github.com/BCN3D/BCN3D-Moveo/) is an open source robotic arm 
that everyone should be able to replicate - with or without modification - at home without the need for highly 
technical knowledge and expensive materials. 
The robotic arm will support several of the existing training itineraries: 
mechanical design, automation, industrial programming, etc.


## History

*Here it is welcome to acknowledge the existing sources that have been used in this project with locations*

## Documentation structure

*How is your documentation organized?*


These guidelines will provide you with a standard structure that is mainly following the product 
life cycle and the technological decomposition. It is implemented in the documentation template available in this project. 
  
For example:
- Introduction
- Specification
- Design 
- Manufacturing
- Assembly
- Use
- Maintenance
- Disposal

And inside each of the sections, if required:
- Mechanical
- Electronic 
- Software 



## Required skills

*What is the specific knowledge a maker shall own to reuse - with or without modification - your product??*

For example:
  
The project echopen need basic knowledge about the medical ultrasound technology such as ultrasound imaging, 
a matter of acoustical impedance, etc.  


## Contribution Process

*Describe here how a maker can contribute to your project*

-  Example of a contribution process:
  - Post an [issue] and briefly outline the changes you plan to make
  - If you are looking for input on what to contribute, browse the issues with the Requests or Bug label
  - Describe branches
  - Describe what a Pull Request (PR) shall contain (detailed description of changes, a summary of the test, 
    issue numbers that the PR resolves)
  - Specify code style 
  - Contributor license agreement


## Last updates 

*What is the last update of your documentation?*

- Last modification (date, time, object of modification, who,...)


## Project team

*Describe here who is the leader and the main contributors of the project*

- Name {E-mail}
  - domain of expertise and role in the project
  - link to personal web page


## License

*What open-source hardware license your project complies with?*


- [Comparison of free and open-source software licences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licences)
- [license of open hardware projects](https://opensource.com/law/15/2/intro-open-hardware-licensing#:~:text=Open%20source%20hardware%20is%20hardware,on%20their%20hardware%20at%20all.)
