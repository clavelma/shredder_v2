- **Definition:** *The functional tree is a top-down decomposition of function into sub-functions that helps to simplify the problem to solve.*

- **Comments:**

  - *A top-down and bottom-up reading of the functional tree provides insight on the “how” and “why”, respectively.*
  - *The decomposition process should be stopped when the technical function is sufficiently detailed to reuse, make, or buy a design solution.*


 ```
1. What minimum documentation should the functional tree provide?
  - A model specifying the kinds of technical functions and their sub-functions in the format of a tree (refer to the functional tree of XYZ Cargo-ADD ONS)

2. How to implement the functional tree?
  - Use functional modeling language for representation, such as  
    - UML (Use Case diagram)
    - SysML (Block Definition, Activity, or Internal Block diagram)
    - SADT/IDEF0 
    - Functional flow block diagram 
  - Use open-source software for modeling the tree representation, such as
    - Papyrus
    - Modelio
    - Capella  
  ```
