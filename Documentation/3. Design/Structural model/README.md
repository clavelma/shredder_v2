# **Structural model**

*I would like to enable makers to understand the physical structure of the product and its components.* 

## **What is a structural model?**
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
  
* A structure is a description of the components (the combination of parts) of a product and their relationships.
* An opportunity to specify the geometric elements, dimensions, topology, and other physical properties of the product.
* The structures are the potential solutions (concepts) as the result of the conceptual design phase.
* The structural model comprises the set of mechanics theories that obey physical laws required to study and predict the behavior of structures.

## **Why should you define structural model?**
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
  
* A structural model helps to describe the geometric elements (design feature, dimensions, constraints, etc.), topology (assembly constraint between components, tolerances, components mating conditions, etc.), and characteristics of the product.
* A structural model helps to decide the physical form of the product and its components to ensure that the structure is fit for its intended purpose. 
* Structural model provides users with a physical model of the product, components, and characteristics of the material at the design phase that enable the stakeholder to understand the geometry, material reaction to external factors, etc.
* The structural model ensures that the structures are safe and fulfill the functions for which they were built.

## **How to document a structural model?**

*Documentation of the structural model can be done in different sections for each project including*

* [Mechanics](https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/WP2.3-Guideline-and-templatefor-documentation-of-OSH-design-reuse/tree/main/Documentation/3.%20Design/Structural%20model/Mechanics)

* [Electronics](https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/WP2.3-Guideline-and-templatefor-documentation-of-OSH-design-reuse/tree/main/Documentation/3.%20Design/Structural%20model/Electronics)

* [Software](https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/WP2.3-Guideline-and-templatefor-documentation-of-OSH-design-reuse/tree/main/Documentation/3.%20Design/Structural%20model/Software)
