# Design

*"To design" refers to the process of originating and developing a plan for a product. So, the product models provide consideration of concepts of product design. Product models serve to answer questions that interest multiple views on the product. Among the product views, there is an agreed-upon ontology of product models named Function-Behaviour-Structure (FBS) where:*

- **Function (F)** stands for **“what the object is for”.**
- **Behaviour (B)** stands for **“what the object does”.**
- **Structure (S)** stands for **“what the object consists of”.**

*Moreover, it should describe the complexity of product via:* 
- **Modular architecture** that describes **“architecture of functions and instructions of the product”.**
