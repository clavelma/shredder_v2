# **Specification**

*The specification consists in describing the product with a "black box" external view to capture the intermediate technical objects (stakeholders, external interfaces, services, and constraints) that serve to, *in fine*, elucidate the product requirements.*

## **How to document the specifications?** 
  
## **1. Stakeholders:**

## **2. External interfaces**

*The image below shows the external interfaces of  ADD-ONS of XYZ cargo as a graph*

## 3. Service *(synonyms: external function, capability)* 
<details>
  <summary>Click to see the guideline!</summary>
  
- **Definition:** *A service is an effect intended by a stakeholder resulting from the interaction of the product with its environment (i.e. what the  product is for).*

- **Comments:**
  - *Services provide users with an exchange value that can be included in an economic system (e.g. airlines buy flight hours).*
  - *Services are intended effects that can be observed from outside the product ("black box" external view), but not from outside an internal component ("white box" internal view).*
  - *Services are defined in a solution neutral-way.*
  - *Services can be stated as follows: The [Product] shall enable [Stakeholder] [Action verb] (e.g. The product shall enable end-user to clean its teeth)*
  - *we often reason in terms of action verbs to communicate expected behaviors, so it would be nice to be able to search designs with action verbs*

  What does contain the minimum documentation of the service to stakeholders?
  
  Example of services for ADD-ONS of XYZ Cargo
  
    - The ADD-ONS shall enable the food producer to store food
      - 1.1 solid (10 kilos)
      - 1.2 liquid (5 litrs)
    - The ADD-ONS shall enable the food producer to heat food
      -  2.1solid (150 deg Celcius)
      - 2.2 liquid (80 deg Celcius)
    - The ADD-ONS shall enable the food producer to cool down food for 4 hours
      - 3.1 solid (6 deg Celcius)
      - 3.2 liquid (6 deg Celcius)
      
    - ...
  ```

### Template of services
  
   * Services to clients
       * The shredder shall enable the ABS&PLA plastic from 3D printing scraps to be reduce into medium or small chips.
       * The shredder shall enable the thermoformable plastic from thermoformable plastic plate scraps to be reduce into medium or small chips.
   * Services to users
       * The shredder shall enable the plastic from user's personal collection to be reduce into medium or small chips.
   * Services to partners
       * The shredder shall enable the plastic from partner's personal collect to be reduce into medium or small chips.
   * Services to media
       * The shredder will serve as a functional example of low tech solution for plastic recycling.
   * Services to european standards
       * The shredder will meet the safety and working standard conditions based on european standards. 
   * Services to environment
       * The shredder in all ramifications, will be safe to use and environmental friendly.

## 4. Constraint *(Synonyms: non function requirement)*

### Template of constraints
  
   * The shredder should be dismantled for recycling purposes
   * The shredder should be realise and operate in a low tech philosophy
   * The shredder should follow the european standards
   * Open source community should be able to reproduce it
   * User should be able to use it in security
   * Ginova should be able to handle the maintenance
   * The shredder should be incorporating in Ginova
   * The shredder should be able to shred the plastic from the collect
   * The shredder should be built using the maximum of the existing prototype
   * The shredder assembly and user should be accessible and open source
