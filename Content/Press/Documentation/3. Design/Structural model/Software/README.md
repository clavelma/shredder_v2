## **How to document the software section of a project?**

 ### **1. Software architecture**
<details>
  <summary>Click to see the guideline!</summary>
 
*The software architecture represents the repository details of all the software that is necessary for reusing and running the project.*

 ```
1. What minimum documentation should the architectural structure provide?

- A model specifying the kinds of components and their sub-components of software in the format of a tree  or graph 

2. How to implement the architectural model?
 
- Use modeling language for representation, such as 
  - SysML (Block Definition, Activity, or Internal Block diagram)
  - UML
- Use open-source software for modeling the tree or graph representation, such as
  - Papyrus
  - Modelio
  - Capella 
  ```
