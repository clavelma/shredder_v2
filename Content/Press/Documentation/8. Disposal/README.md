# **Disposal**

*I would like to enable makers to understand the process of discarding (getting rid of) something that we no longer need or want.* 

## **How to document a disposal process?**

*Disposal instructions can guide the makers to provide the minimum documentation for disposal of a product or its disposable components.*

*The purpose of the disposal process is to remove a system element from the operating environment with the intent of permanent termination of its use. This process can deal with any hazardous or toxic materials or waste products following the applicable guidance, policy, regulation, and statutes.*

 ### **Disposal instructions :**

  - **Definition:** *Disposal instructions identify the process of removing a system or its component, ensuring the proper handling of any environmentally sensitive materials, and sending the remainder to surplus storage or sale.*

What does comprise the documentation of disposal instructions?

 1. Distinguishing the disposable and non-disposable components or products
   - Recyclable: a process of turning waste into another form of new and reusable materials
      - Identifying the material of disposable components or products.
         - Disposable products are most often made from
            - Polystyrene 
            - Cotton
            - etc.
     - Determining what material can recycle many times
     - How to recycle the components or products and their type of materials?
   - Non-recyclable: the components or products that design for single-use, which means they get discarded immediately after use.
      - Identifying the material of components or products.
         - Textiles
         - Ceramics
         - Etc.
      - How to dispose the non-recyclable components or products and their type of materials?
         - Incineration: This type of waste disposal involves the dumping off method where you eliminate waste materials via combustion.
         - Landfill: It involves collecting, transporting, dumping, and burying waste in a designated land.
   - Conditionally recyclable: this tells you if any additional steps are required before recycling the component or product.
      - Identifying the conditional recyclable materials 
      - How to conditionally recycle the components or products and their type of materials?
 2. Identify the product lifespan for disposing or recycling
 3. How to disassemble the components a product for recycling/disposing?
 4. Describing the environmental assessment: it is the assessment of the environmental consequences of disposing or recycling a product before the decision to move forward with the proposed action.
   - The negative consequences of disposable products on the environment if sustainability isn't factored into disposal options.
   - How to select the disposal or recycling process to have a less environmental impact?
