Here we describe the advancement of the project at each stage : 

--- Friday 11 February 2022 ---

- Organisation of the Github repository :

.New roles repartition :
  --> @willie becoming the new project_advancement_manager
  --> @Maxime becoming the new Data_manager

.Google Drive files transfer to Github repository

.Adding the Supply folder

.Adding a To Do list shared folder : each person of the group will have a list of task each week. The person concerned fill in itself the tasks regarding 
the advancement. @Willie is responsible of picking up the informations from this Microsoft To Do list and organize them in this document :

14/03 - 21/03 : 

Tom : adding CAD repository and shredder CAD files.

####  Meeting Day 15/2/2022
  * Tom: He is making the CAD design for storage which will come with the shredder stand. This is a neccessity to make room for easy storage and 
         finding of tools needed during shredding. Also, some of the plastic chips can be stored momentarily there.
         
  * William:  Making research on how to come about the system design of the shredder. The system design was initially made but the professors 
              want a more detailed one, which is professionally presented.
            
  * Maxime: He is the Data manager. His first task was reviewing the documentation on Github, make necessary corrections and update new tasks to be made.
            Additionally, he is working on the panel of the shredder, to fix the emergency button in an appropriate place
 
 #### Meeting Day 1/3/2022
  * We did not do anything significant with regards to our Laboratory work. Tom could not make it for the meeting as he was not feeling too well.
  * We all met with Jean Francois. There were controversies with the objective of our project. We felt we were missing something and eagerly 
    needed to be in the right tracka s time is fast spent.
  * At the end of the meeting, he told us he is looking to see more technical designs and with these designs we can argue or defend our points to them.
  * We can say we now know what will be done and we are focusing only on the Shredder as it was supposed to be.
  In conclusion, we learned not tot underestimate any given project.
  
  
  ####  Meeting Day 8/3/2022
      We are still awaiting the arrival of the new motor.
  * Louis:  Completed the SYSML diagram for the shredder.
  * Tom and Maxime: It was suggested to the professor by Tom that we want to change to a metal top for the shredder. The profesors did not find this necessary. 
    Therefore, in today's meeting, they are working of the dimensions of a wooden surface, the load exerted by the motor and taking bigger sizes into considerations. 
    With this, they can estimate the resistance of the wooden surface to the load.
  * Margaux:  We are asked to come up with some ways to Test the functionability and speed of our shredder. Today, Margaux is making research on how the different
    sizes of the plastics to be shredded affects the spped of the shredder.
  * William: He is working on the hinges of the shredder.
  * Nsongurua:  The testing/experimentations to be carried out on the shredder will vary, So I will start researching on different parameters that can be used
    in this experimentation.
