the advancement. @Willie is responsible of picking up the informations from this Microsoft To Do list and organize them in this document :

14/03 - 21/03 : 

Tom : adding CAD repository and shredder CAD files.

####  Meeting Day 15/2/2022
  * Tom: He is making the CAD design for storage which will come with the shredder stand. This is a neccessity to make room for easy storage and 
         finding of tools needed during shredding. Also, some of the plastic chips can be stored momentarily there.
         
  * William:  Making research on how to come about the system design of the shredder. The system design was initially made but the professors 
              want a more detailed one, which is professionally presented.
            
  * Maxime: He is the Data manager. His first task was reviewing the documentation on Github, make necessary corrections and update new tasks to be made.
            Additionally, he is working on the panel of the shredder, to fix the emergency button in an appropriate place
 
 #### Meeting Day 1/3/2022
  * We did not do anything significant with regards to our Laboratory work. Tom could not make it for the meeting as he was not feeling too well.
  * We all met with Jean Francois. There were controversies with the objective of our project. We felt we were missing something and eagerly 
    needed to be in the right tracka s time is fast spent.
  * At the end of the meeting, he told us he is looking to see more technical designs and with these designs we can argue or defend our points to them.
  * We can say we now know what will be done and we are focusing only on the Shredder as it was supposed to be.
  In conclusion, we learned not tot underestimate any given project.
